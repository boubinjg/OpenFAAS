# OpenFAAS v0.1

OpenFAAS is an open source software suite used to create fully autonomous aerial systems (FAAS).
OpenFAAS allows users to connect consumer DJI drones to programmable routines that include 
programmable Java routines that include access to computer vision and deep learning software packages
like OpenCV, DLIB, and Tensorflow.

OpenFAAS comes with a docker image and installation scripts for all requisite
software, and an Androidx86 VM to communicate with DJI drones from edge systems.

This is an early release of OpenFAAS, and is still rough around the edges.
Future releases will (1.0 +) will improve the user experience and expand the
