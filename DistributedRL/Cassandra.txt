CN docker container has scripts to run Cassandra and run cqlsh, the cassandra CLI tool

In the CLI tool:
    CN test keyspace created using the followig line:
    CREATE KEYSPACE CN1 WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};


    CN test table created using the following line:
    CREATE TABLE CN1.test (id varchar PRIMARY KEY, image blob);

Python script "insert.py" inserts image "DJI_0006.JPG" from /home/ into 
the test database. The image is encoded as base64 and sent to the DB.
